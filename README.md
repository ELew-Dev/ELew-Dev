# 👋 Hey, I’m Ethan

## 🧠 Human-Centered AI | Systems Thinker | Builder

I'm a CS Master's student (AI concentration) with a background in Communications and a growing portfolio of projects at the intersection of **AI, behavior, and human experience**. My work explores how we can design tools that don’t just *function*—but actually *serve people* in meaningful ways.

Currently focused on:
- Building a **Journaling Chatbot** that promotes emotional clarity and self-coaching
- Studying for the **AWS Solutions Architect – Associate** certification
- Learning Python deeply, and applying it to intelligent systems, automation, and backend tools


## 🛠 Tech I’m Using & Learning
- **Languages:** Python (core), basic Go (learning)
- **AI Tools:** LangChain, OpenAI API, Hugging Face, Pipedream
- **Cloud & Infra:** AWS (SAA cert in progress), GCP (Colab, Cloud Run), Docker
- **Data & ML:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Pinecone, RAG
- **Dev Tools:** VS Code, GitHub, Jupyter, Retool


## 🧭 Guiding Question:
> “Do you want to engineer AI systems… or do you want to understand how they reshape humanity?”  
> I’m choosing both.


## 📌 Goals
- Ship projects that blend **technical depth with behavioral insight**
- Build a career around **education, systems thinking, and tech that empowers people**
- Land a remote-friendly role that bridges **AI, cloud architecture, and user-facing problem solving**
