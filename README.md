# Hi, I'm Ethan 👋

I like exploring how things work, especially the night sky, using Python and data. I build small projects and visualizations to see patterns, test ideas, and keep track of what I learn. Right now, I’m focused on astronomy, coding, and making notebooks that combine research with hands-on experimentation.


## 🔧 What I’m Working On
- **The Living Sky** – Investigating stellar motion and constellations over time using real astronomical datasets. Visualizing patterns and temporal changes to explore assumptions about permanence in the night sky.  
- Strengthening Python skills through data analysis, scientific computing, and visualization.  
- Learning cloud infrastructure and deployment workflows (basic usage)


## 🛠 Technologies & Tools

**Languages & Frameworks**  
- Python  

**Data & Scientific Computing**  
- Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn  
- Astropy, Skyfield  
- Matplotlib, Plotly  

**Developer Tools**  
- Git, GitHub  
- VS Code, Jupyter  


## 🎯 Goals
- Build projects that combine coding, data, and visualization to explore real-world systems.  
- Translate complex data into clear, interpretable insights.  
- Develop a portfolio demonstrating both technical skill and independent research.  
- Grow into roles that allow both technical problem-solving and conceptual thinking.
