# Hi, I’m Ethan 🌌

I am a Software Engineer and Data Specialist focused on exploring complex systems through Python and data visualization. I build projects that bridge the gap between independent research and hands-on technical experimentation.

### 🔭 Current Focus
* **The Living Sky:** Developing a kinematic simulation to model stellar motion over secular timescales. I use real-world astronomical datasets to visualize the "shear" of constellations, challenging the assumption of a static night sky.
* **Scientific Computing:** Strengthening my Python workflow with a focus on data analysis, visualization, and computational physics.
* **Cloud & Deployment:** Exploring foundational cloud infrastructure and automated deployment workflows.

### 🛠 Technical Toolkit

| Category | Tools & Technologies |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Languages** | Python, SQL |
| **Data & Science** | Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Astropy, Skyfield |
| **Visualization** | Matplotlib, Plotly |
| **DevOps & Tools** | Git, GitHub, VS Code, Jupyter, Virtual Environments (venv) |

### 🎯 Professional Goals
* **System Modeling:** Building data-driven visualizations to translate complex, multi-dimensional systems into interpretable insights.
* **Independent Research:** Developing a portfolio that demonstrates both technical execution and the ability to self-direct through deep-domain topics (Astronomy, Cosmology, Physics).
* **Technical Problem Solving:** Growing into roles that require a balance of conceptual thinking and robust software engineering.
